# gendentity
Let your software support a diverse range of gender identities and pronouns in its language and data.

Currently, there are no files in the repo, but we start to collect information [in the wiki](https://github.com/lenaschimmel/gendentity/wiki).

This project was started at the CCCamp 2015 in the Queer Feminist Geek Village.
